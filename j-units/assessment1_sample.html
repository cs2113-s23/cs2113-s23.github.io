	<hr>
	<font size=+2 align=center>Instructions</font><br>
	<br>
	This assessment is designed to be completed in fifty minutes or less. Your code must work on any valid inputs to receive credit.<br>
	<br>
	Complete the template below such that you will provide code to solve the following problems. When you are satisfied with your solution,
	you should upload your solution to Marmoset. Marmoset will grade your solution within about a minute; you
	may modify your solution and resubmit while taking this assessment to get a higher score as necessary.<br>
	<br>
	<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1>
		<tr>
			<td>Write test cases in the template below to find the unknown bug in code that performs the following: a function called <code>
			checkCode</code> which will check if a string entered by the user is a valid item code or not. A valid item code will have the following 
			characteristics:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>It will start with an integer between 1 and 999 (without preceding zeros).</li>
				<li>Next, a period will appear.</li>
				<li>One or more words composed of letters, separated by spaces, will appear. Each word must be capitalized.</li>
				<li>The last word is followed by one or more spaces.</li>
				<li>Finally, the code will end with an optional five digit number.</li>

	Download the code <a href="./DriverJava1_sample.java">template</a> for this assessment (right mouse click to save the file). <b>Change the file name to be
	<code>DriverJava.java</code></b>. It's technically Java code, but you don't have to worry about that. It's contents are as follows:<br>
	<br>
	<code>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public class DriverJava{<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static String[] tests = {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"checkCode 1.A ",<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"true",<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//WRITE YOUR TESTS BELOW IN THE SAME FORMAT (USE COPY-AND-PASTE)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "};<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static String getTest(int i){<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return tests[i];<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static String getResult(int i){<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return tests[i+1];<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	Just follow the format of each test case according to the example:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Start a test case with "</li>
		<li>On the same line, include the function name, followed by a space, followed by the input</li>
		<li>Finish the first line by adding a ", followed by a comma, followed by a newline.</li>
		<li>On the next line, you'll include the expected output: start with a ", followed by either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>,
		followed by a ", followed by a comma.</li>
		<li>Don't change any of the other lines in the file! Make sure you're only adding in lines.</li>
	</ul>	<br>
	Ask your TA to eyeball the format if you have questions, although Marmoset will let you resubmit your file if there are any typos.<br>
